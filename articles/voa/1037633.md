An exact date for the new rules has not been set, but officials said they would be in effect in early November.</p><p> </p><p>Administration officials told reporters that people seeking to enter the United States illegally would continue to be subject to the so-called Title 42 order put in place by former President Donald Trump that prevents many border crossers from seeking asylum.</p><p> </p><p>The Biden administration has been under pressure from U.S. lawmakers, as well as Canada and Mexico, to lift the restrictions, which they say has cut off families and deprived the United States of billions of dollars of tourism dollars.</p><p> </p><p>In a related matter, the Indonesian resort island of Bali is preparing to welcome  international travelers from several countries back to its renowned beaches on Thursday after being closed for more than a year due to the pandemic. Visitors from China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates will have to show proof of being fully vaccinated, undergo testing upon arrival and quarantine in their hotel rooms for at least five days.</p><p> </p><p>The World Health Organization released Wednesday a proposed team of experts to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic that has sickened nearly 239 million people around the globe, including nearly 4.9 million deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. [[ https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/ ]]</p><p> </p><p>The proposed team of experts, known as the Scientific Advisory Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens, includes specialists in fields like laboratory safety and biosecurity, a nod towards speculation among Western governments pressing for consideration of whether the virus emerged from a laboratory in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first detected in late 2019..</p><p> </p><p>A team of investigators dispatched to Wuhan earlier this year concluded the outbreak likely began as an animal-to-human transmission, but the report was criticized by many as incomplete, mainly due to the Chinese government’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation. In July, a senior Chinese health official rebuffed WHO’s plan to further study the origins of COVID-19.
